Reddit Thread Summarizer
This application uses Flask to provide a web interface for summarizing Reddit threads. It leverages a fine-tuned text summarization model (T5 by default) to generate concise summaries of thread comments.

🚀 How It Works
The application connects app.py (web interface) with test.py (summarization engine).

When a user submits a Reddit thread URL:

Comments are extracted

Text is cleaned and processed

A summary is generated using a fine-tuned model

The summary is displayed on the results page

⚙️ Setup Instructions
✅ Method 1: Use the Installer Script (Recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
python install_dependencies.py
python app.py
⚠️ Method 2: Manual Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask praw python-dotenv pandas torch transformers datasets tqdm matplotlib scikit-learn sentencepiece
python app.py
🧩 Method 3: Use the Fallback Version (No ML Model)
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask praw
python app_fallback.py

🛠 Troubleshooting
Missing Libraries
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python install_dependencies.py
Model Loading Issues
Use fallback:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app_fallback.py
Reddit API Errors
Ensure valid credentials in test.py

SentencePiece Errors
Install with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install sentencepiece
Other Errors
Check console output for details

🧩 SentencePiece Error Example
You might see:

cpp
Copy
Edit
ImportError: T5Tokenizer requires the SentencePiece library but it was not found in your environment.
Fix it by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install sentencepiece
🧠 Model Notes
Default model: T5-small

T5 requires SentencePiece

To avoid SentencePiece, switch to BART in test.py
