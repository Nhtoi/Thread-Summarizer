Reddit Thread Summarizer
This application uses Flask to provide a web interface for summarizing Reddit threads. It leverages a fine-tuned text summarization model (T5 by default) to generate concise summaries of thread comments.
ðŸš€ How It Works
The application connects app.py (web interface) with test.py (summarization engine).

When a user submits a Reddit thread URL:
Comments are extracted
Text is cleaned and processed
A summary is generated using a fine-tuned model
The summary is displayed on the results page
